# Head On

Head On was developed during my time at the school Yrgo in gothenburg. The project was a part of our *Game Design* course, here wew were to use our knowledge of game design to create a game. The project was not my idea.

During this project, my role was as a programmer, and the game was developed in the Unity Game Engine, with the programming lagnuage C#.

During the development process, the programming that I mainly focused on was the player character, the signal-button logic, and the system for grabable items.
